            I just wanted to take a moment to tell you how truly special you are to me. Your laughter lights up my day, and your kindness warms my heart. I appreciate everything you are and all the little things you do that make life so much brighter.
            
            Whenever I think of you, Iâ€™m reminded of the beauty in the worldâ€”just like a garden filled with roses and tulips, each unique and stunning in their own way. You bring that beauty into my life, and Iâ€™m grateful for every moment we share.
            
            Always remember that you are loved and cherished more than you know. Thank you for being you!
            
            ðŸ’– With all my heart,
            Akash</p>
